This is a supporting package for [skia-safe](https://crates.io/crates/skia-safe), which provides safe Rust bindings to the [Skia Graphics Library](https://skia.org/).

## Organization

This package contains three components. 

- First, full configuration and build support for Skia in [`build.rs`](build.rs) and  [`build_support/`](build_support/).
- Additional C bindings to help out bindgen with stuff it has problems with or to work around linker errors. These are [`src/bindings.cpp`](src/bindings.cpp), and [`src/shaper.cpp`](src/shaper.cpp).
- And a number of functions that are used to download prebuilt binaries.

### Skia Build Support

Building Skia is quite exceptional, a number of prerequisites need to be available and configured properly for the target platform.

To configure and build Skia, [`build_support/skia.rs`](build_support/skia.rs) does all the hard work: it pulls `depot_tools/` and `skia/` from Google's repositories and a number of additional dependencies by executing `skia/tools/git-sync-deps` with Python. After that, it configures Skia with Google's [GN](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/refs/heads/master/README.md) tool, and finally builds it by giving control to the `ninja` executable from the `depot_tools/` package.

### Binding Generation

The files `src/*.cpp` contain the C++ code that Rust needs to interact with Skia's codebase. These files are processed by the [Rust's binding generator](<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen>) that uses libclang for the layout computation _and_ are also compiled by [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).

If both steps went well, the resulting Rust binding code is written to `OUT_DIR/skia/bindings.rs`, and the `skia-bindings` library is found in the output directory.

### Debug Builds

By default, and for performance reasons, Skia is built in release mode even when cargo creates debug output. Skia debug builds can be enabled only by explicitly setting the environment variable `SKIA_DEBUG=1`.

### Prebuilt Binaries

Because building Skia _and_ creating the bindings is slow and depend on a number of components that lie outside the Rust ecosystem, we decided to experiment with prebuilt binaries.

Whenever a new version of `rust-skia` is built from the `release` branch on our CI server, the resulting Skia libraries, `skia-bindings` library, _and_ `bindings.rs` are compressed and uploaded to the releases tab of the [skia-binaries repository](<https://github.com/rust-skia/skia-binaries/releases>).

And whenever the build script detects that `skia-bindings` is built from inside a crate _and_ a prebuilt archive is available that matches the repository's hash, platform, and features, it downloads the package, unpacks it, and skips the full build step of Skia and the bindings.

### Prebuilt Binaries in an Offline Environment

Some users may not have a stable internet connection or are building `skia-bindings` in an offline environment. You may download binaries manually from the [skia-binaries repository](<https://github.com/rust-skia/skia-binaries/releases>) in an environment where you do have internet access.

To use the binaries in an offline build, the environment variable `SKIA_BINARIES_URL` must be set. This environment variable must point to the `tar.gz` file where the binaries are located, prepended with `file://`.

```bash
export SKIA_BINARIES_URL='file://path/to/skia-binaries.tar.gz'
```

### Changing the executable used as `ninja` and `gn`

On some systems, the bundled `ninja` and `gn` executables may not work (as it does on NixOS). To remedy
this, the executables used can be set using the following environment variables:

| Variable             | Description                                                                                                | Default                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `SKIA_NINJA_COMMAND` | The `ninja` command to run. It can be either a command name or an absolute path.                           | `ninja` by default, `ninja.exe` on Windows |
| `SKIA_GN_COMMAND`    | The `gn` command to run. It can be either a command name or a path that starts at Skia's source directory. | `bin/gn`                                   |

### Changing the Skia source directory

In some cases, one may wish to provide an alternate Skia source directory.  This can be achieved by
setting `SKIA_SOURCE_DIR`, which must be an absolute path to a Skia source directory with all
dependencies.

### Using system libraries

By default, numerous libraries Skia depends upon are built in addition to Skia itself. In the event that this is not wanted (say, if the crate is being built as part of a package's build routine,) this behavior can be disabled by setting the `SKIA_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES` environment variable.

Also note that there is one exception here. [FreeType](https://freetype.org/) is only embedded on Android platforms by default. If your platform does not support a more recent FreeType version, skia-bindings must be built with the feature `embed-freetype`.

## Build Customization

Besides of the features `gl`, `vulkan`, `metal`, and `textlayout` that can be directly specified when the package is added as a cargo dependency, the Skia build can be customized further in `build.rs` by adjusting one of two structs that are defined in `build_support/skia.rs`:

### `BuildConfiguration`

This struct represents the top level build configuration for `skia-bindings` and contains a number of individual feature flags.

### `FinalBuildConfiguration`

The `FinalBuildConfiguration` is created from the `BuildConfiguration` and contains name value pairs used by GN to parameterize the Skia build and preprocessor defines used to create the `src/bindings.rs` file and the `skia-bindings` library.

## Cross Compiling for Linux

It's possible to cross compile Skia and the Rust bindings for different architectures on Linux. Set the following environment variables and then invoke cargo with the desired [--target triple](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html#compilation-options):

 * `CLANGCC`: Command line to invoke clang to cross-compile C code for the desired target architecure. This command line may include a `--target=<triple>` option.
 * `CLANGCXX`: Command line to invoke clang to cross-compile C++ code for the desired target architecure. This command line may include a `--target=<triple>` option.
 * `SDKTARGETSYSROOT`: Path to the target sysroot.
 * Either:
   * `CC`/`CXX` providing command lines to cross-compile (clang is not required) and `HOST_CC` providing a command line for build for the host.
   * `CC_<target>`/`CXX_<target>` providing command lines to cross-compile (clang is not required).

 When using a Yocto SDK for cross-compiling, all of the above environment variables will be set when entering the Yocto SDK environment by sourcing the `environment-setup-*` script,
 and `CC`/`CXX` are set to cross-compile. That means it is also necessary to set `HOST_CC`, which usually works when set to just `gcc`.

 For linking your Rust application, you may also need to instruct cargo to use the correct linker and look for native library dependencies (such as Skia's FreeType dependency) in the sysroot. This can for be done via a `.cargo/config` file or via environment variables. For example if your Rust target platform is `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and you're Yocto SDK's target is `aarch64-poky-linux`:

 * `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=aarch64-poky-linux-g++`
 * `RUSTFLAGS="-Clink-args=--sysroot=$SDKTARGETSYSROOT"`
